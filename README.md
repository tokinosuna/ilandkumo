**i LAND kumo** is more than an app; it's a gentle rebellion. In a world that demands we be loud, this is a space designed for the quiet. It's a digital sanctuary where you can safely translate your feelings, ideas, and fleeting thoughts into tangible, floating clouds in your own private sky.

## Core Philosophy & Vision

The design of `i LAND kumo` is built on three core pillars:

### 1. Calm Technology
Our goal is to be a companion, not a distraction. There are no notifications, no data-driven metrics, no social pressures. The app exists quietly, offering support only when you seek it.

### 2. Emotional Design
Every interaction is a ritual, not just a feature. From the soft, breathing animation of the clouds to the mindful ceremony of letting a thought go, we turn cold functions into warm, emotional experiences.


## ✨ Features

*   **☁️ The Cloud Diary:** Transform your thoughts into beautiful, uniquely colored clouds that drift peacefully across your screen.
*   **🌅 The Living Sky:** The background is a dynamic, procedurally generated gradient that slowly shifts from dawn to dusk, creating a calming, ever-changing environment.
*   **✨ The Ritual of Letting Go:** Deleting a thought isn't a harsh action. It's a mindful ceremony where the cloud gracefully floats up and fades away, symbolizing a gentle release.
*   **🔒 Absolute Privacy (The Cornerstone):** All your data is stored **exclusively in your browser's LocalStorage**. There is no server, no database, no user accounts, and no tracking. Your island is yours and yours alone. This is not a feature; it's a promise.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

We chose a simple, powerful, and privacy-respecting stack to bring this vision to life.

| Technology | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| **HTML5 / CSS3** | For a solid, semantic, and beautiful structure. |
| **JavaScript (ES6+)** | To handle all logic client-side, ensuring privacy and performance. No frameworks needed. |
| **GSAP (GreenSock)** | To create the high-performance, natural, and unique floating animations that give the clouds life. |
| **LocalStorage** | The heart of our privacy promise. All user-generated content lives and dies in the user's browser. |

## 🚀 Future Roadmap

The journey for `i LAND kumo` is just beginning. Here are some of the stars we're navigating towards:

*   **Constellations:** Allow users to link related thoughts, forming a personal "star map" to visualize their mental and emotional journey.
*   **Gentle Breeze:** An opt-in feature to see a single, anonymous, positive thought from another user drift across your sky, reminding you that you're not alone.
*   **Export Your Sky:** A tool to download all your clouds as a `.txt` file, giving you full, permanent ownership of your thoughts.
*   **PWA (Progressive Web App):** Make `i LAND kumo` installable on mobile and desktop for a more immersive, offline-first experience.

### A Final Word from the Creator

> "I was once the person who was too afraid to speak up, who would just cry alone after being misunderstood. I want this place to be a space where you can let it all out, and know that you are not alone in feeling this way. It's not your fault if you have to pretend to be an extrovert to fit in. It's okay. It's okay to go shopping, eat a meal, or enjoy what you love by yourself. You are wonderful, just as you are."
